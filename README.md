# WiSense Dashboard SDK 
(https://dashboard.wisense.in)

# I. Device scripts: 
Use these scripts to simulate devices for demo or testing required at different stages of deployment.<br> 
As of now scripts directly simulate "WXI-RH/T-10" device. Device name and MacId can be changed in [device.json](https://github.com/iotbang/wisense_dashboard_sdk/blob/master/device_scripts/device.json).<br>
Refer the [README](https://github.com/iotbang/wisense_dashboard_sdk/blob/master/device_scripts/README.md) included in the [device scripts](https://github.com/iotbang/wisense_dashboard_sdk/tree/master/device_scripts) directory.


# II. Rule scripts: 
These are the important custom scripts used inside the rule-chain nodes.
These scripts are implemented in [create_and_clear_alarms.json](https://github.com/iotbang/wisense_dashboard_sdk/blob/master/create___clear_alarms.json) rule-chain.<br>
In order to alerts and alarm feature work - this rule-chain should be made as root.
